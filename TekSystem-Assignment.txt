Question 1:
The Sieve of Eratosthenes is the earliest means of finding prime numbers. A description
can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes . Write a Spring boot
application that implements this. The application should provide a front-end (preferably
React) that takes a maximum integer value as an input, and displays the list of prime
numbers between 0 and that number. Provide unit tests.

Answer : Please refer to files PrimeNumber.js, PrimeNumber2.js, PrimeNumber3.js

Question 2: 
You are modifying a human resources application. The current Employee class looks like
this:
Currently everyone is an Employee and some of those are Managers, which is
determined by calling the isManager() method. The company has now started hiring part-
time employees, so the system must be modified to keep track of them.
Create a new implementation of the Employee class which provides the flexibility
required to support the new part-time employee notion. You are free to refactor this class
as required and add additional classes if needed.

Answer: Please refer to files, Employee.java and Test.java
